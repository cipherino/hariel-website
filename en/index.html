        <h1>MANIFESTO UMANISTA PER UN CINEMA
IN INTELLIGENZA ARTIFICIALE</h1>

            <ul class="manifesto">

                <li>No more excuses. Anyone can make cinema now. You have a responsibility.</li>
                <li>Error is your ally. The only truly interesting image produced by AI is its hallucinationâ€”that moment when the machine stops imitating us.</li>
                <li>Donâ€™t be seduced by high definition. Donâ€™t fear noise and imperfections. Theyâ€™re what will make your algorithmic image compelling.</li>
                <li>The dialogue with the machine happens in natural language. You need to know the words. And choose them wisely.</li>
                <li>Every algorithm carries its own aesthetic. Let it erupt.</li>
                <li>Keep a human element in the production process. No further specifications needed.</li>
                <li>Return to the history of cinema before the machine chews it up for you.</li>
                <li>Nostalgia for the auteurs you loved is poison. Open-source AI [whose code is accessible and modifiable] is the antidote. Crave forms that are yours alone.</li>
                <li>Every algorithmic image has its own algorithmic sound. Every algorithmic sound has its own algorithmic image.</li>
                <li>Study theory, learn the language of cinema. The rest is automatic processing.</li>
                <li>Your authorial identity lives in the struggle against the machine. Never comply. Unless youâ€™re deceiving it.</li>
                <li>Pursue deformity. Thereâ€™s nothing more boring, false, and rhetorical than photorealism.</li>
                <li>An initial image is all you need for your story.</li>
                <li>A film made with AI is always a film about AI. But be careful: if your writing makes that obvious, youâ€™ve already failed.</li>
